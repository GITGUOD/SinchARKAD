Spot lights -> worm stops every so often

Blue and pink pattern for worms

Problems:
Floor consists of blue and pink grids.

The worm covers 6 tiles where first half is blue and second half is pink, matching the floor grids.

The worms move like the snake game

During every beat, you can redirect the worm.

When the spotlights are turned on, the worms stop for that beat. You cannot redirect them at this beat.

You get points based on the placement of the worms

One point for each part of the worm matching the floor, blue part on the blue tile and pink part on the red tile.

Worms collide, you get zero points.

Input of the dancefloor grid: 10 to 25 both Height and Width

How many times the lights are turned on: 4 < T < 10

int T, how many times the light turns on

N represents the N lines, describing the snake.
